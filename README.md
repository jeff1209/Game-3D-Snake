# Game-3D-Snake

This project was inspired by BJSXT. Before that, I developed a classic 2D Snake game application using Java. Then I took a VR course (UW, IND E 543) and was very interested in VR technologies. So I decided to make a 3D Snake game that could be applied on VR devices. This is why I started this project.

In this project, I used Unity technologies including Unity Light System, Coordinate System, Physical System, Prefabs, following camara (and how to make it smooth), Audio System, etc. The scripts were wrote in C#. 

The game development has been finished and the next step I'm working on is to apply it on VR devices.
